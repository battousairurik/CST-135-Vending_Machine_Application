# CST-135-Vending_Machine_Application
Class Project

Authors: Michel Weaver, Nicholas Robertson, Charles Witten, Rose Marie Lizama

Background: This project is a class project for CST-135. We are tasked with creating a vending machine application and have currently created the Dispenser Class which houses most of the functionality of the actual vending machine. We have created accompanying Product Class, Snack and Drink subclasses, and then populated the Dispenser with Product objects to be displayed.

Week 3 we have added the comparable interface to both the Snack and Drink classes so that these objects can be sorted with regards to one another. 

Currently the project is still under construction.

Approach: We are creating simple classes with data fields that are used in the overarching project. We have hardcoded a set number of objects into the Dispenser to begin with.

Use: Currently the user needs access to Eclipse, or a JDK that can run the .java files. Vending_Machine_Application.7z contains the project files. Within the project, Main.java contains the main method for execution. Once the main method is called the user will then receive a list of all stocked products. This will change as the project calls for it.

The main method now also calls the compareTo method of the snack class and displays that it works in regards to two separate chip objects.
